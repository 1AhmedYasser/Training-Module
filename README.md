# Bürokratt's Training Module

Bürokratt's Training Module is a tool to help primarily customer support agents and service managers to create, edit and otherwise manipulate Bürokratt's e-services via a graphical user interface. This includes setting up Rasa-based user stories, making X-road / REST / database requests where and when appropriate and so forth.

Technically, it is a service combined of different generic technical components, meaning that there is no custom Training Module component as such.

# Scope
